> Habitat simplifies creating, managing, and running containers. Habitat allows you to

but one of the places it particularly shines is striking the right balance between 
manageability, portability, and consistency in managing a fleet of microservice 
applications. For most users, that means running in tandem with a scheduler and a 
container management platform. Today weâ€™re going to explore how to run Habitat 
applications in Kubernetes.
